# JobScheduler
This is the backend system that allows to schedule jobs/tasks to run at a specific time and/or repeatedly at regular intervals. For simplicity, assume the job is just to write "Hello World" on the console or a file. What is important is that user can provide details on schedule of a job and when the trigger occurs, the job is to be executed, basically print "Hello World". A schedule can be hourly, daily, and weekly. If it is hourly, then we can configure which minute of the hour the job should run. If it is daily, then we might want to configure the job to run a specific time of the day. If a job is weekly, then we might want the job on specific day of the week.

#Execution
Execute the main file thau is "Main.java"
